# Summary
As pandemics (including the COVID-19 crisis at time of writing) pose threats to societies, public health officials, epidemiologists, and policymakers need tools to assess the impact of disease, as well as a framework for understanding the effects and tradeoffs of health policy decisions. The `epimargin` package provides functionality to answer those questions in a way that incorporates irreducible uncertainty in both the input data and complex dynamics of disease propagation.  

The `epimargin` software package consists of: 
1. a set of Bayesian estimation procedures for epidemiological metrics such as the reproductive rate ($R_t$), which is the average number of secondary infections caused by an active infection

2. a flexible, stochastic epidemiological model informed by estimated metrics and reflecting real-world epidemic and geographic structure, and 

3. a set of tools to evaluate different public health policy choices simulated by the model.

The software is implemented in the Python 3 programming language and is built using commonly-used elements of the Python data science ecosystem, including NumPy [@harris2020array], Scipy [@virtanen2020scipy], and Pandas [@mckinney2011pandas].

# Statement of need

- data-driven analysis of policy choices

- data preparation choices made explicit and out of the box

- modularity and extensibility of methods and model 

- speed 

- visualization


The `epimargin` package has been used to drive a number of research projects and inform policy decisions in a number of countries:

1. lockdown, quarantine planning, migrant return policies, and vaccine distribution in India and Indonesia (at the behest of national governments, regional authorities, and various NGOs)

<!-- `Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike. -->
